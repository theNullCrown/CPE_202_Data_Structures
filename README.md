**Course Learning Outcomes**
The student should be able to:
• Describe and define the Abstract Data Types (ADT) covered, including stacks, queues, priority queues, binary
search trees, AVL trees, hash tables, and graphs.
• Understand, explain, and track by hand alternate (iterative, as well as recursive) implementations ofmethods
associated with each ADT.
• Analyze for performance all algorithms associated with ADTs, reason about correctness and effectiveness of
procedures, compare and contrast array and linked implementations of certain ADTs.
• Implement and test each ADT implementation as a generic program.
• Use ADTs effectively in software applications
